![Design preview for the NFT preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).


**To do this challenge, I used HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools you like to help me complete the challenge. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
